# Florida-Electricity-Demand
## Overview
This project predicts a region's energy consumption in Florida, based off of its 
location, date, and the forecasted high and low temperatures within that day. I am 
currently a student at the University of Florida who is majoring in Sustainability 
and the Built Environment. Going in with the focus of making the world more sustainable, 
I decided to provide a helpful tool to create a more resilient and efficient electrical 
grid. As Florida continues to have an increase in temperature, the strain on our 
energy intensifies. This tool can be used to see which regions greatly need a more 
resilient grid, which can prevent many challenges we face and ensure we use energy efficiently.
